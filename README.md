# Custom Chatbot: Udacity Generative AI Project

This project contains a development of a custom chatbot based on the [PubMedQA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiaojin/PubMedQA)
to answer medical questions. The answers to the medical questions would be based on journals available on the [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

A prompt engineering method of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented in this project.
